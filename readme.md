CIS 3110 FINAL PROJECT: BUILD YOUR WEBSITE
Fall Semester 2021

Team presentations 
t
You must present your website on the days of your presentation. And also, you have to show the source code and explain it during the presentation. And then submit the link individually on canvas and submit the presentation on the blackboard prior to your presentation. It should be around 20-minute presentation. 10 minute each presenter will speak.
- Your slide should have title, summary why you choose this topic? What all features you have used to make it impressive,
- You can talk about the bootstrap features you are using, design any animation, events.
- Website presentation 
- Source code
- Conclusion with the references

Given your team's new development template prepare to generate 3 to 4 pages per team member, in support of a business objective. 

Your final project should follow these steps. 

1. Define the industry it will address. This can be any sector of the economy that your group deems interesting. 
2. Address issues that impact the industry. Perhaps there is the need for a kind of website that fills an unmet need, for example, engaging students in the industry, out of college. 
3. Your page can contain a login page if required, profile, terms of use, privacy policy, a 'contact us' page, as well as the actual product, itself. This might be a social network, a gallery of interactive media (such as you have built heretofore), or other web-based interactive product. Rest it’s your creativity you can have dropdown menu bar or some more features most welcome to practice it and show in your presentation
4. Leverage the accumulated template of bootstrap, cookies, for loops, data iteration, and another interactivity toward producing the objective. Evaluation is important I will be giving you an evaluation form to evaluate you the presentation.That will be consider your presence for the day. ThanksDevika Maini
